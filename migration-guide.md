# Context7-Powered Design System Migration Plan

## Setup Context7 Integration

### 1. Install Context7 MCP Server
```bash
# Method 1: Using Smithery (Recommended)
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @upstash/context7-mcp --client cursor

# Method 2: Manual Cursor Configuration
# Edit ~/.cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Restart Cursor/Claude Code
After configuration, restart your editor to activate Context7.

## Migration Strategy Using Context7

```

### Phase 5: Component Library Specific Migrations

#### Individual Component Updates
```bash
# For each component, use prompts like:

"Migrate Form components to use latest React Hook Form integration and validation patterns. use context7"

"Update Table component to use latest React patterns for virtualization and performance optimization. use context7"
```

#### Design System Architecture
```bash
"Review and update component architecture to use latest compound component patterns and composition. use context7"

"Migrate theme system to use latest CSS-in-JS patterns or CSS custom properties approach. use context7"

"Update component API design to follow latest React and TypeScript best practices. use context7"
```

## Validation Commands with Context7

### Pre-Migration Analysis
```bash
"Analyze my current package.json and identify all dependencies that need updates with breaking changes. use context7"

"Review my current codebase and identify deprecated patterns that need migration. use context7"
```

### Post-Migration Validation
```bash
"Validate my updated build configuration and ensure all tools work together properly. use context7"

"Review my migrated components for any remaining deprecated patterns or anti-patterns. use context7"

"Check my updated testing setup for completeness and best practices. use context7"
```

## Automated Migration Workflow

### Step 1: Dependency Analysis
```bash
# Use Context7 to analyze and update package.json
"Review my package.json and create an updated version with latest stable versions, noting any breaking changes. use context7"
```

### Step 2: Configuration Files
```bash
# Update all config files systematically
"Update my TypeScript config to latest best practices. use context7"
"Update my Vite config for optimal performance. use context7"
"Update my Tailwind config with latest features. use context7"
"Update my Storybook config to latest version. use context7"
"Update my test configuration files. use context7"
```

### Step 3: Code Migration
```bash
# Component-by-component migration
"Migrate my Button component to latest patterns. use context7"
"Migrate my Form components with latest validation. use context7"
"Migrate my Layout components to modern CSS. use context7"
```

### Step 4: Documentation Updates
```bash
"Update my README with latest setup instructions and examples. use context7"
"Update my Storybook documentation with latest patterns. use context7"
```

## Benefits of Using Context7 for Migration

1. **Up-to-Date Information**: Always get latest official documentation
2. **Version-Specific Guidance**: Context7 provides version-aware migration paths
3. **No Hallucinations**: Real examples from official sources
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Works with all major React ecosystem tools
5. **Time Savings**: No need to manually check documentation sites

## Best Practices

### Effective Context7 Usage
- Always include "use context7" in your migration prompts
- Be specific about current and target versions
- Ask for breaking changes analysis
- Request step-by-step migration guides
- Validate each tool independently before moving to the next

### Migration Safety
- Create feature branches for each major tool migration
- Test thoroughly after each migration step
- Keep rollback plans for major changes
- Update CI/CD pipelines alongside tool updates

This approach ensures your design system stays current with the latest ecosystem improvements while maintaining stability and reliability.
